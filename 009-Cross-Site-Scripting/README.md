# Cross Site Scripting
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

## Search Query XSS
In the Security Shepherd UI, click `Challenges -> XSS -> Cross Site Scripting 1`. The goal of `Cross Site Scripting One` Challenge is to take what we learned in lecture about the dangers of injecting scripts into a vulnerable web application.

Try several different XSS payloads to see which ones are successful. 

Hint: The input is filtered so the basic `<script>alert(xss)</script>` may not work!

## Moar XSS Filter Bypasses
In the Security Shepherd UI, click `Challenges -> XSS -> Cross Site Scripting 2`. This challenge is similar to the previous one except more filtering is in place.

Tip: Try out a payload and then use the `View Source` functionality of the browser to see what is being filtered. XSS is all about trial and error.

## Bonus
Polyglot XSS payloads are versatile and can be executed in multiple contexts. For instance, a payload like onclick=alert() can be executed both in an HTML tag like <button onclick=alert()> and in a JavaScript string like confirm('onclick=alert()'). These payloads are particularly useful in Penetration Testing as they can reduce noise and minimize the effort required to test for XSS vulnerabilities. To improve your understanding of polyglot XSS payloads, it is recommended to research them further and experiment with them using the Security Shepherd XSS challenges.
