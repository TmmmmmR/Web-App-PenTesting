# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

In this challenge, we want to find a private message for a user who isn't listed by default.

### Intercept the HTTP request 

Let's click Show this Profile button and check the HTTP requests :

![](./images/intercept.JPG?raw=true)

As we can see, a different `userId[]` is sent for each username. Let's send this request to Intruder for further analysis :

![](./images/intruder_1.JPG?raw=true)

Here we are going to point to the userId parameter, and then create a simple number iterator under `Payloads > Payload type > Numbers` to generate/send numeric payloads within a given range and then use it for the parameter of our choice, Then we launch the intruder attack : 

![](./images/intruder_2.JPG?raw=true)

Once finished, we can filter the results by adding a simple search/match based on the string `Result Key is` :

![](./images/intruder_3.JPG?raw=true)

Which will give use the cid related to the hidden user :  

![](./images/intruder_4.JPG?raw=true)

### Bonus
The vulnerable application has a number of IDOR challenges. Can you work through the rest of them?
