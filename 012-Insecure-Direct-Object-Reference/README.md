# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

The goal of the challenge `IDOR 1` in the Security Shepherd is to teach users about the importance of protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. The challenge requires the user to access data related to other users, which should not be accessible to them. The user must then find a way to access the data of other users by exploiting the IDOR vulnerability in the application.

### Intercept the HTTP request 

In `IDOR 1 challenge, we want to find a private message for a user who isn't listed by default.

Go to`Challenges > Insecure Direct Object References > IDOR 1` Let's click Show this Profile button and check the HTTP requests :

![](./images/intercept.JPG?raw=true)

As we can see, a different `userId[]` is sent for each username. Let's send this request to Intruder for further analysis :

![](./images/intruder_1.JPG?raw=true)

Here we are going to point to the userId parameter, and then create a simple number iterator under `Payloads > Payload type > Numbers` to generate/send numeric payloads within a given range and then use it for the parameter of our choice, Then we launch the intruder attack : 

![](./images/intruder_2.JPG?raw=true)

Once finished, we can filter the results by adding a simple search/match based on the string `Result Key is` :

![](./images/intruder_3.JPG?raw=true)

Which will give use the cid related to the hidden user :

### Bonus
The vulnerable application has a number of IDOR challenges. Can you work through the rest of them?
